The terms you've listed are primarily associated with styles of Belgian beer, each with its unique characteristics, flavors, and traditions. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Pale Ale (Belgian Pale Ale)**: This style is known for its balance and moderate strength. Belgian Pale Ales are less bitter than their British counterparts and often have a fruity, mildly spicy yeast character. They are amber to copper in color and may have a slightly sweet malt profile with a dry finish.

2. **Dubbel**: A Dubbel is a rich, malty beer with some spicy / phenolic and mild alcoholic characteristics. Not as much fruitiness as the Belgian Strong Dark Ale but some dark fruit aromas and flavors may be present. Medium to full-bodied. The color ranges from copper to dark brown. Dubbels are also known for their complexity and a significant degree of malty sweetness.

3. **Tripel**: The Tripel style is characterized by its high alcohol content, pale color, and complex flavors and aromas. Despite its strength, it's often quite approachable, with a soft malt character, moderate spiciness, and a dry finish. The yeast contributes significant fruity esters, often with notes of citrus and sometimes banana.

4. **Strong Golden Ale**: Belgian Strong Golden Ales are pale to golden in color, with a complex, often somewhat spicy, fruity character. These beers are strong, with a noticeable alcohol presence, and a dry finish despite the initial sweetness. The yeast character is quite pronounced, offering fruity and spicy flavors.

5. **Strong Dark Ale**: This style is darker, richer, and more complex. Belgian Strong Dark Ales have a variety of dark fruit flavors, like raisins, plums, and cherries, combined with spicy, malty, and sweet flavors that hide the alcohol content well. These beers are deep amber to brown in color and may have notes of chocolate or caramel.

6. **Quadrupel (Quad)**: The Quadrupel is the strongest of these Belgian styles, with alcohol levels that can reach or exceed 10% ABV. It's a deep amber to brown beer, with a rich, complex, and intense flavor profile. The Quad has flavors of dark fruits, such as dates and figs, combined with layers of maltiness, sweetness, and alcohol warmth. It's often enjoyed as a sipping beer due to its strength and complexity.

Each of these beer styles offers a distinct tasting experience, reflecting the rich brewing traditions of Belgium. They are celebrated for their depth, complexity, and the skill required to brew them successfully.
