   - **De Koninck**: A classic Belgian Pale Ale that is well-balanced, with a slight malty sweetness, subtle hop bitterness, and a touch of fruitiness. It's a staple in Belgium and serves as a quintessential example of the style.

2. **Dubbel**:
   - **Westmalle Dubbel**: One of the definitive examples of the Dubbel style, brewed by the Trappist monastery Westmalle. It features rich malty flavors with notes of dark fruit, caramel, and a hint of chocolate, along with a complex yeast character.

3. **Tripel**:
   - **Chimay Cinq Cents (White)**: This Tripel, produced by another Trappist monastery, Chimay, is golden in color, with a spicy, fruity yeast character, balanced by a soft malt background and a dry finish. It's aromatic and slightly hoppy with a noticeable alcohol warmth.

4. **Strong Golden Ale**:
   - **Duvel**: A benchmark for the Strong Golden Ale style, Duvel is renowned for its spicy, dry character, with a pronounced hoppy bitterness and a high level of carbonation that gives it a champagne-like effervescence. It's both refreshing and strong.

5. **Strong Dark Ale**:
   - **Gouden Carolus Classic**: Brewed by Het Anker, this beer is a fine representation of the Strong Dark Ale, offering a rich and complex array of flavors, including caramel, dark fruit, and hints of spice. It embodies the depth and richness associated with the style.

6. **Quadrupel (Quad)**:
   - **St. Bernardus Abt 12**: Often compared to the renowned Westvleteren 12, St. Bernardus Abt 12 is a quintessential Quad, known for its full body, rich malty sweetness, and complex flavors of dark fruit, bread, and a hint of chocolate.
