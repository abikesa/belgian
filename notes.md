### Man/Frontiers/Malum - Tradition vs. Craft
5. **Temperament/Heretical - Trappiste**: This category fits Trappist beers, which you described well. They are brewed in a monastic tradition with unique yeast strains, much like Stille Nacht uses specific ingredients to create its distinctive profile. However, Trappist beers are more about preserving a long-standing tradition within a spiritual context, rather than pushing the boundaries of what beer can be.

6. **Expression - Craft**: Stille Nacht sits perfectly within this category. It’s crafted not in a monastery but in a modern brewery setting, using innovative techniques and ingredients like white candy sugar, which are not typical of traditional beers. This aligns with the craft beer movement's spirit, which emphasizes creativity, experimentation, and the personal touch of the brewer, much like the expression phase in music where individuality and personal style are paramount.


### Art/Bustle/Se - Ale vs. Lager
3. **Diatonic/Mundane - Lager**: Lagers are often perceived as the more mainstream choice in the beer world, analogous to the "mundane" in your framework. They're generally brewed with simpler, less expressive ingredients like corn syrup, which can be seen as the diatonic scale of brewing—straightforward and widely accepted. The fermentation process of lagers occurs at colder temperatures and uses bottom-fermenting yeast, which results in a cleaner, crisper taste, often less complex than ales.

4. **Chromatic - Ale**: Ales, including the Belgian strong ale like Stille Nacht, use top-fermenting yeast which works at warmer temperatures. This leads to a broader range of flavors and aromas, akin to the chromatic scale in music—more notes and variations. Ales can include ingredients like sugar, which while disqualified under the Reinheitsgebot (the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516), contribute to a richer, more diverse taste profile.


### God/Order/Prohibitum - Reinheitsgebot
1. **Root - Reinheitsgebot**: The German Purity Law that mandates the use of only water, malt, hops, and later yeast, sets a foundational guideline for beers like lagers that often stick to these basic ingredients. It's the "root" of traditional brewing practices in many ways.
2. **Hefeweizen - Weihenstaphaner**: A very compelling, fresh, slightly sweet, banana-esther flavor is perceptable. This is the most natural, and by far the gentlest beer of all time
